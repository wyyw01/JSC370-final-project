Hello, this is Wei. This is the repository for my JSC370 Final Project: analysis on covid19 data, where I analyze various covid19 data to answer the questions 1. When and where were people more likely to get covid19? and 2. What builds the “luck” (not getting covid or mild severity if get covid19 or survive from extremely severe symptoms)?
Here is the link to my final project website: https://wyyw01.github.io/JSC370-final-project/.
